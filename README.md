# Hugo blog template

This is a template for making a obsidian vault based site that is hosted on github pages.

# Setup

If you don't have hugo set up on your local mechine, visit the quick start guide: [gohugo.io/getting-started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

To run the site locally, run:

```bash
make site # if you have make installed
(cd site && hugo server -t terminal) # this is what make runs
```

To edit the content of the website, the docs directory is an obsidian vault, open obsidian and open the folder as a vault.
